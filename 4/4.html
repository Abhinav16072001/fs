					Aloo chaat, a dish made with pieces of boiled and fried potatoes mixed with spices and chutney, is popular throughout South Asia, but particularly so in Pakistan and northern India, as well as parts of the Indian province of West Bengal and the Bangladeshi region of Sylhet. Eaten as a snack, a side dish or a light meal, aloo chaat can vary by region in terms of specific spices and chutneys used.

				In the Philippines, banana cue is a very popular street food made with saba bananas, a variety of banana popular for cooking in the island nation. The bananas are deep-fried and coated in caramelized brown sugar before being skewered on bamboo sticks.

				A flat and round kebab usually made of ground beef or mutton, the chapli kebab has its origins in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar. Ingredients such as wheat flower, eggs, onions, tomatoes, ginger, coriander, green chilies and spices such as garam masala and chili powder are mixed in with raw minced meat before being molded into a round shape and either fried or deep-fried. Popular throughout Pakistan, chapli kebabs are also eaten in India and eastern Afghanistan, served with naan, with rice or in a bun or sandwich bread alongside chutney, salad or yogurt.

				Fish and chips is one of the most quintessentially British foods today, but its roots lie elsewhere in Europe. Chips, or french fries, originated in France or Belgium, and fried fish was introduced to Britain by way of Portugal and Spain. Enterprising Brits decided to serve battered cod or haddock and chips together in the mid-1800s. Sprinkled with salt and vinegar, it’s also often served with a side of mushy peas, curry sauce, gravy or ketchup. Traditionally, fish and chips were wrapped in old newspaper, but nowadays grease-proof paper (sometimes with faux newspaper print) is used. One of the few foods not rationed during World War II, fish and chips are beloved throughout the United Kingdom and English-speaking commonwealth nations such as Australia and New Zealand. You can also find some amazing fish and chips spots in the U.S.

				While gelato is the Italian word for ice cream, what some people may not realize about Italian gelato is that is quite different from ice cream. Made with milk, cream and sugar and then flavored with nuts, fruit or other flavorings, gelato is much lower in fat than traditional American ice cream. By Italian law, it must be made of 3.5 percent butterfat (as opposed to the 10 percent butterfat dictated for ice cream by American law). You’ll also find that gelato has more flavor and less air whipped into it than ice cream, giving it a richness that has made it popular throughout Italy as well as the rest of the world.

A grilled or cooked sausage is served on a steamed hot dog bun and garnished with whatever the eater pleases, ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, coleslaw, cheese and chili being some of the most common condiments. Variations in preparation and condiments differ by region, and you’ll find some of America’s best hot dogs scattered throughout the country.

				Mango sticky rice, or khaoniao mamuang as it’s called in Thai, is a popular Thai dessert that is also prevalent in other Southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Sticky steamed rice is mixed with coconut milk that has had salt and sugar added to it and then set so that the rice absorbs the milk. The rice is then served with some mango slices on top or on the side, and more coconut milk is then drizzled over it. The dish is particularly popular during April and May, summer months in Thailand as well as peak season for mangoes.

				Originating in the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia, naan is a type of bread traditionally associated with Indian and Pakistani cuisine but is found throughout Central and South Asia, as well as the Middle East. Made with wheat flour, water and traditionally ghee (but sometimes butter), as well as sometimes yogurt or milk, naan is traditionally cooked in a tandoor oven. Brushed with ghee or butter and served hot, the flatbread is meant to be used to scoop up other foods, particularly curries, although it can have a filling as well.

				Originating in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec, poutine is a classic Canadian street food of french fries topped with cheese curds and brown gravy. While easily found on the street, poutine is also found on the menus of many restaurants in Canada — even some locations of chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s and KFC. Many variations of poutine exist, and the dish can include meats such as bacon, chicken, sausage or Montreal-style smoked meat. Poutine is so beloved that you’ll even find it on the menu at some higher-end restaurants, albeit topped with things such as foie gras, truffle, caviar or three-pepper sauce.

				Believe it or not, although ramen is a Japanese dish, many sources say that it actually originated in China. Modern-day ramen, however, is unquestionably associated with Japan, with nearly every region of the island nation having its own version. Chinese wheat noodles are served in a broth that is typically meat or fish-based, and soy sauce or miso is used as flavoring, as well as toppings such as a boiled egg, sliced pork, crispy duck, scallions or dried seaweed. Popular throughout the world, ramen can be found at street vendors in Japan, as well as ramen shops, karaoke halls, amusement parks and more. The Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen museum in Osaka is well worth a visit for ramen lovers, and you can even make your own instant ramen to take home.
